        <p>Hello! My name is Charles James. I am a Web Applications Developer living in Kingston, ON.
          I really enjoy designing, building and implementing websites. Hopefully one day I can build a
          website for you</p>
        <br />
        <p>I first started enjoying working with code and building things with technology a few years ago.
          Since then, I haven't looked back. I never run short of interesting problems and challenges to
          solve. I mean, who doesn't love the feeling of overcoming a complex challenge?</p>
        <br />
        <p>When I'm not working on a project, I can usually be found practicing on my guitars, playing video
          games, or just hanging out with friends.</p>

        <p>P.S. I am very much a coffee addict:).</p>
