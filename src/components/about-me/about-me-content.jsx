		    <p>Welcome to my site! My name is Charles James and I design and build
          websites, and other digital marketing solutions. From simple updates
          to complete development solutions, I have you covered.</p>

		  <br />

		    <p>Over the last few years I have been building random projects in my
          spare time, learning how to become a developer to be reckoned with.
          When I'm not designing, coding, or updating software, I can usually
          be found plucking away at my guitars, playing video games, or just
          hanging out with friends. I love being creative, and designing and
          building websites is a creative outlet that I have become passionate
          about.</p>
